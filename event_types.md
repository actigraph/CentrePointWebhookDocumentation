# Event Types & Payloads

Each event has as similar JSON schema, but a unique `payload` object that is determined by its event type.

## Raw Processing Complete Event

Triggered when the processing of the RAW sub-second data of an upload has completed.  This event is specific to the processing of "RAW" sub-second data and only applies to studies utilizing the CentrePoint Insight Watch (CPW) or other studies with a 'RAW-only' data collection mode. This event can be used to denote when a RAW data retrieval request can be made in the CentrePoint (V3) API (via Data Retrieval request) for a specific data range. For supported studies, this will be the first event that is trigged in the data processing pipeline.

**Webhook event name:**

`raw_processing_complete`

|Name|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:----------|
|study_id|Number|CentrePoint Study ID|

## Upload Event

Triggered when the processing/ingestion of an upload occurs from any CentrePoint client (such as ActiSync, CentrePoint Data Hub (CDH) and/or CP Mobile Device).

There's three variations of the event which is denoted in the "status" property: *started* (denotes that processing/ingestion has started), *completed* (denotes processing/ingestion has completed), and *error* (denotes an error occurred during the upload processing).

This event relates to the processing specific to EPOCH (or 60-second/minute) summary data which is displayed in the CentrePoint Web Portal. This event is the final step in the processing pipeline for uploads coming in to the CentrePoint system.

**Webhook event name:**

`upload`
